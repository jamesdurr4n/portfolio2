Menu
    - Menu functioned exactly as proposed. 

Task List
    - Music was limited to a an embedded Spotify player. Full version would have in-built music player.
    - Decided to have side bar be expandable for better user comprehension + branding, with inclusion of the StudBud logo.

Task List Form 
     - Removed priorities for tasks, as well as day countdowns. I wanted my StudBud to be used daily, having countdowns, habit trackers and priority was not this StudBud vision for artists. 

Kanban Board
    - This Kanban board is the exact same as proposed. However with coding issues, local storage of task list was not passed into the Kanban board. For the ideal StudBud vision, this wouldn't have occured.

Music Player
    Playlist:
    - Playlist was limited to an embedded spotify playlist. For the true vision of the StudBud website, there would be a curated playlist implemented into the interface, with a playlist creator.

Pomodoro Timer 
    - The Pomodoro Timer visually fills up as time passes. When the Pomodoro circle timer is full, it is break time for the user. The user can also choose their break times, after doing 4 short breaks the user can choose a long break

Book List Section
    - Instead of having books from an online database, I decided that it would be better to manually enter the details. As StudBud is aimed at artists, artists typically would recieve/read more unconventional books/papers. To make sure there isn't any missing books from using an online API database of books, manually entering the books allows for less frustrations for the user. 

Stopwatch
    - Stopwatch functioned and was visually the exact same as proposed. However, in the proposal there was no reset button, so a reset button was added.
